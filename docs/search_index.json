When we talk about procedures and guidelines, we're very much talking about standards and conventions. Standards and conventions allow the products of research to be easily consumed, interpreted, adapted and re-used. For example, the metric system did wonders for standardizing how we measure distances and weight. The chaos that would ensue if every entomologist took specimen measurements with their own system - or determined wingspan from different points of origin across the same species! Standards and conventions allow us to explore our data and outputs to greater extents than historically possible by helping us leverage computers; computers rely on standards to parse and merge data. For instance, without the standardization of how markers of climate change are recorded, we would be unable to pool the massive amounts of globally collected data that is used to monitor and fight climate change. These qualities of standards and conventions - easy consumption, interpretation, adaptation, and re-use - are integral to robust, transparent, reproducible research; these qualities underpin the development of a strong evidence base on which to conduct further research and inform practices and policy.

File and Data Management Data Presentation Writing and Citing Glossary File and data management covers content related to how to organize, name, and store research data. Broadly speaking, this covers all aspects of research data management. Data presentation covers how data should be presented when summarized or analyzed. Writing and citing touches on tools and approaches to support properly formatted and cited open publications.

"],["file-and-data-management.html", "1 File and Data Management", " 1 File and Data Management Last updated 2022-01-11 Well-organized data is critical to transparency, reproducibility, and generally maintaining one’s sanity when conducting research. When we talk about file and data management, we may be referring to one of many aspects of making our data understandable to others, to a computer, or to our future selves that have succumb to memory lapses. Making data comprehensible is really about well-structured and communicated metadata that is, whenever possible, implemented according to conventions or standards. So, when we talk about file and data management, broadly speaking, we’re talking about File naming and file naming conventions Directory structures Organizing and formatting data at the variable level Directory structures, being more complicated, bring with them the need to add additional documentation, such as a description of the directory structure and what we might expect to find where. It will also often include more detailed documentation about how to interpret what is inside specific files; one example of this is the data dictionary that describes each of the variables collected for the study. Organizing and formatting data is a discussion about the best way to sort and parse our data into columns and rows so that we can effectively produce summaries, statistical calculations, and visualizations; a core concept that you will be introduced to in this guidelines document is that of \"tidy data\". "],["file-naming.html", "2 File Naming", " 2 File Naming Last updated 2022-01-11 File naming isn’t exactly fun, but it is crucial for organizing, describing, and managing all kinds of work, especially research. So, let’s talk about the file naming conventions that you will be expected to use while at UBCO. We’ll start with the rules, we’ll then break these rules down and explain the processes behind them. "],["quick-reference.html", "2.1 Quick Reference", " 2.1 Quick Reference File names should only contain letters in the English alphabet, numbers from 1-9, dashes -, and underscores _. Do not use spaces or special characters, including # % &amp; &lt; &gt; : \" /  | ? * { } $ ! ' @ + ` = File names should be broken down into components that are separated by underscores _. If more than one word is needed in each component, these are separated by dashes -. All files should start with your last name and all other components should be meaningful (read on for what it means for a file name to be meaningful!) There are four variations on how these guidelines are implemented depending on what your file contains. 2.1.1 Lab reports and manuscripts Format LastName_Project_File-contents_Version.file-type Example Pither_BIOL116RProject_Manuscript_V0.docx 2.1.2 Figures and plots Format LastName_Project_Figure-title_Version.file-type Example Pither_BIOL116RProject_Figure-freq-plot_V1.png 2.1.3 Analysis Format LastName_Project_Analysis_Version.file-type Example Pither_BIOL116RProject_Analysis_V0.xlsx 2.1.4 Data Format LastName_Date_Project_Data-file-description.file-type Example Pither_20210921_BIOL116RProject_Data.csv "],["whats-in-a-name.html", "2.2 What’s in a name", " 2.2 What’s in a name File names need to achieve two primary goals, they need to make sense to a human reading them and they need to be constructed in a way that allows a computer to parse or process them. That is, file names should be human interpretable and machine readable. How do we achieve this? Human interpretable To be human interpretable, a file name needs to be meaningful. To do this, it needs to convey some basic information to a person reading it. We do this by integrating metadata into the file name. The metadata elements we include are: Who created the file The date on which it was created The project to which it is connected The nature of the contents of the file If it’s been modified The type or format of the file That is, we should be able to look at a file and tell, who created it, when it was created, what it is related to, what is inside of it, if it has been updated, and what application I should expect to be able to open it with. As we’ll see shortly, we don’t always include a date, and we don’t always include information about modifying a file. All said, that’s a fair bit of information to hold in a file name! Machine readable What does it mean for a file name to be machine readable or machine interpretable? It means building our file names in such a way that we can easily organize them so that they can be sorted by an application and in a way that makes sense to us. It also means building our names according to set patterns, which can then be parsed along known delimiters. Lastly, it means building our names in such a way that if we move them from one computer to another, from one application to another, or from one operating system to another, the files remain interpretable in exactly the same way. How do we do this? We avoid special characters and follow conventions. Special characters Special characters are all characters except: Any character that is a part of the English alphabet Numbers from 0 - 9 Dashes - Underscores _ This means that a space \" \" is a special character, which means that your file names should not have spaces. When operating in a multi-lingual or non-English environment, this can prove problematic, but it is an unfortunate legacy of the development of computer standards that has yet to be fully resolved. Conventions Convention has file naming proceed in the following order, with each element separated by an underscore _, and words within an element joined with a dash -. The file type is generally added with a period . and is usually automatically generated when an application creates a file. Element-1 _Element-2 _Element-3 _Element-4 _Element-5 .Element-5 Last-Name _Date _Project _File-Contents _Version .File-type Dates Dates should be written in the following format yyyymmdd. They should contain no spaces, no dashes, no words, just 8 numbers. Months and Days that are from 1 - 9 should be led by a 0. For example, January 23, 2020, should be written 20200123. When written this way, your computer will always sort your files from the earliest date to the latest date. Keeping track of dates is especially important for data because the date on which your data was collected has direct relevance. Dates are less important for things like figures because they are derived from previously dated data. Versions Version tracking is achieved in file naming by adding _Vn where n is the version number. With each major change, we increase n by 1. So version 1 would read _V1, and when updated, it would read _V2. Versions are very important for things like manuscripts and interpretations of data, such as figures and other visualizations, which we will continue to change and modify throughout a project. Data, however, while it has a collection date, should not be modified, and should not then be versioned. "],["an-example.html", "2.3 An example", " 2.3 An example So what does this look like? Say you’re in BIOL 116 and you’re working on your research project. Your research project involves: Preparing the beginning of a manuscript that states your research question, hypothesis, and proposed methods. Conducting your experiment and recording your data. This process might span more than one day. Updating your manuscript, describing any changes that were made to your methods. Organizing the results of your experiment and interpreting and visualizing your data. Updating your manuscript to include your results and your interpretation of these results, including a visual interpretation. Completing your manuscript by discussing the importance of and / or limitations of the experiment, and finally producing a conclusion. In this scenario, we have 1 project, 1 manuscript, 1 dataset, and at least 1 figure. In addition, our dataset is constructed from data collected over several days, and our manuscript is revised 3 times before final submission. So, first we will come up with a project name, and then we will date our data and version our figures and manuscript. And we’ll see how this evolves over the course of several days. Day 1 We create the following file: Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V0.docx This is our manuscript, so it will get a version, but no date. Looking at it, we quickly see that this is a lab report (Lab-report), authored by someone with the last name Pither (Pither) associated with a BIOL 116 Research Project (BIOL116RProject), that it has only just been created (V0), and that I should expect it to open in Microsoft Word (docx). Let’s imagine that I will put my research question, hypothesis, and methods in this document and submit it. Day 2 Today, I conducted the first part of our experiment and collected some data. Now we have the following files: Pither_20210921_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V0.docx We have not changed our manuscript, so there’s no change to the name. However, we have collected some data. We can easily see who collected this data (Pither), when it was collected (September 21, 2021), that it’s connected to the BIOL 116 Research Project (BIOL116RProject), and that it’s data related to PH exposure. Lastly, it is formatted as comma separated values (csv), which can be opened by any spreadsheet program or text editor. Day 3-5 I continue to collect data over the next several days, and here is what my files now look like: Pither_20210921_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210922_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210923_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210924_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V0.docx Again, we have not changed our manuscript, so there’s no change to the name. However, we have collected some more data related to PH. We have one file for each day, organized from the earliest day of collection to the most recent. Day 6 Today, I did two things. I have no more data to collect, so I updated my manuscript to include any modifications made to my original methods section, I then submitted this. I also started to analyze my data; to do this, I merged all my data into a single file for analysis. Now my files look like this: Pither_20210921_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210922_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210923_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210924_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_BIOL116RProject_Analysis_V0.xlsx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V0.docx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V1.docx At this stage, I have my data collated into a document where I can work on it without impacting the original data. We can see that I have done this in Excel (xlsx), and that I should expect to be able to open this file in Excel. I also now have a V1 of my manuscript, as I have now added a new section to it; when submitting it, my TA knows that the file with V1 should have this updated section. Day 7 Today, I built two visualizations using the data in my analysis document, one linear regression and one bar plot of frequency counts; I save these as images to insert into my manuscript. I then updated my manuscript to include my results and these two figures and submitted V2 of my manuscript. Now my files look like this: Pither_20210921_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210922_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210923_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210924_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_BIOL116RProject_Analysis_V0.xlsx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Figure-freq-plot_V0.png Pither_BIOL116RProject_Figure-linear-reg_V0.png Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V0.docx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V1.docx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V2.docx We can start to see the advantage here of naming conventions. I can easily see which files are which, what they contain, and what their timeline of development is. Also, my computer easily sorts these into meaningful categories - my data is grouped together, sorted by date. My analyses, figures, and manuscripts are all respectively grouped and sorted by version. Day 8 I got feedback that my linear regression model had an error in it. So I fixed this today, added the new figure into my manuscript, and wrote the discussion and conclusion sections. I’m now ready to submit. Here is what my files look like now (I will be submitting V3 of my manuscript): Pither_20210921_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210922_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210923_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210924_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_BIOL116RProject_Analysis_V0.xlsx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Figure-freq-plot_V0.png Pither_BIOL116RProject_Figure-linear-reg_V0.png Pither_BIOL116RProject_Figure-linear-reg_V1.png Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V0.docx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V1.docx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V2.docx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V3.docx "],["directory-structures.html", "3 Directory Structures", " 3 Directory Structures Last updated 2022-01-11 Now that we’ve covered naming conventions, let’s pretend that you store everything on your computer in a single folder. Imagine how long it would take you to find data you collected on a specific day a few years ago. Instead of keeping every document in a single place, we often organize our files using directory (aka folder) structures. This helps us save precious time and improve our productivity. One major aspect of Open Science is ensuring transparency in the research process. This includes sharing files from all the steps of the research lifecycle (i.e. a priori hypothesis, study design, data, analysis etc.) with others so that our research can be understood and replicated more easily. The way we currently organize folders and files on our computer may make sense to us, but a problem arises when we need to share those folders and files with other people. A folder name that is meaningful for us may make no sense to another person. So let’s cover some conventions to help you organize the files on your computer in a way that is meaningful to both you and others. "],["directory-hierarchies.html", "3.1 Directory Hierarchies", " 3.1 Directory Hierarchies First, let’s talk about how to properly structure a folder hierarchy. The highest-ranking folder is generally called the root directory, or sometimes the top-level folder. We’ll call it the root directory here. This folder will contain all of the subfolders and files related to a particular project, including its data, analysis, lab reports etc. It will also contain what is called a readme file. The structure should look something like the following: Project-Folder/Experiment-Data/File-1 Project-Folder/Experiment-Data/File-2 Project-Folder/Experiment-Analysis/File-1 Project-Folder/Experiment-Report/File-1 Project-Folder/Experiment-Report/File-2 Here, our root folder is called Project-Folder and it contains three subdirectories, one for data, Experiment-Data, one for analyses, Experiment-Analysis, and one for a report Experiment-Report. Each subdirectory then contains one or many files. "],["directory-naming.html", "3.2 Directory Naming", " 3.2 Directory Naming Key file naming conventions, such as avoiding special characters, are equally as important for directories as they are for naming files. Remember, we consider special characters to be anything other than letters in the English alphabet, numbers from 1-9, dashes \"-\", and underscores \"_\". In case there is any doubt, here are some examples of what are considered special characters - characters you want to avoid! # % &amp; &lt; &gt; : \" /  | ? * { } $ ! ' @ + ` = Remember: spaces, \" \", qualify as special characters when it comes to file naming. Remember: when we name the root folder we want to clearly communicate what the project is. And similarly, within this root folder, we want clearly labeled subfolders for each relevant aspect of the project. Common discrete subdirectories include ones for figures, data, manuscript etc. "],["readme-files-and-data-dictionaries.html", "3.3 readme files and data dictionaries", " 3.3 readme files and data dictionaries When naming files we embed metadata into our file naming conventions to encode relevant information for the reader. But we can only store so much information in a file name. So we also include three additional files: A _README file which resides in our root folder and elaborates on the contents of our folder structure. A _README file that resides in our data directory and discusses some of the particulars of the how, where, and who did the actual data collection. A _DATA-DICTIONARY file that also resides in our data directory and elaborates on how our data is stored and organized. These files - containing a brief description of the major folder contents, naming conventions, and data structure - are critical for transparency and reproducibility because they allow others to easily understand the contents of your directory and data without needing to ask you. This is especially helpful when working with a group or sharing directories with others. General rules A readme file and data dictionary should: Exist in at least two locations, the root directory and the data directory. Be prepended with an underscore \"_\". This will push these files to the top of the directory for easy access. _README and _DATA-DICTIONARY files should be in all caps, so they really stand out; this should be the first thing you look at when looking at any directory or folder, as this is your guide to its contents. File formats Readme files and data dictionaries should be written in plain text, for this will ensure that the files describing your project can be opened on any computer. You will often see readme files called _README.txt or _DATA-DICTIONARY.txt. Our example readme and data dictionaries use a plain text format called markdown. markdown We recommend that you create your readme files as markdown, a way of formatting plain text files, allowing us to provide additional meaning to our content. For example, in plain text, if we want to emphasize content, we don’t really have a way of doing this. In markdown, we can use italics and bolding if needed. We can also create lists and tables. Learn the basic syntax of markdown here. "],["root-folder-readme.html", "3.4 Root folder readme", " 3.4 Root folder readme To create a root folder readme file, use any markdown or text editor (e.g. Typora, notepad etc.), open a new file and save it to the root folder for your project, ensuring the file type is .md. Name your readme file _README.md. Next, we want to add some content to our _README.md. The purpose of this document is to describe the directory structure of our project. To adequately describe our directory structure we should include: A brief description of the project or purpose of the root folder Date when the root folder was created and who created it Date when the readme file was last updated and who updated it A brief description of the contents of each major folder within the root folder A brief description of file naming conventions used within the directory To see an example root directory readme file click here.

A data dictionary helps others understand the meaning of each element in your datasets within the broader context of the project. Typically you will have an individual readme file for each dataset. This file should include: Date when the data dictionary was created and who created it Date when the data dictionary file was updated and who updated it A description of the raw data file A description of each variable for all datasets including data type, units, number of levels if categorical, and a description of variable levels where relevant When describing variables you need to provide the full names and definitions of each variable because often variables are abbreviated in datasets To see an example data dictionary click here. "],["example-biol-116.html", "3.7 Example BIOL 116", " 3.7 Example BIOL 116 In our previous BIOL 116 example, we used a flat folder structure to hold all of our files. With this example, no readme files were created, as we made the assumption that the project was \"simple\" enough in its structure to not warrant a readme file. On reflection, this was an oversight, and we probably should have created a readme file describing what was in each file. Neither did we create a data dictionary. We’ll do better on future assignments now that we know about the value of both forms of documentation. Anyway, in that example, we ended up with one folder of files that looked like the following before submitting our final assignment: Pither_20210921_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210922_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210923_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_20210924_BIOL116RProject_ph-data.csv Pither_BIOL116RProject_Analysis_V0.xlsx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Figure-freq-plot_V0.png Pither_BIOL116RProject_Figure-linear-reg_V0.png Pither_BIOL116RProject_Figure-linear-reg_V1.png Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V0.docx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V1.docx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V2.docx Pither_BIOL116RProject_Lab-report_V3.docx We can see that this might start to get unwieldy if we have a few more files joining the party. So let’s break this apart into folders… Top Level folder BIOL116RProject/ Inside of BIOL116RProject we have one file and four subdirectories: _README.md Data/ Analysis/ Figures/ Report/ Note that we created a _README.md file to describe our directory structure.

Say you’re a student in BIOL 125 working on a research project testing mealworm food preferences… Day 1 On day one of our research project, we are asked to prepare the beginning of a lab report that states our research question, hypothesis, and proposed methods. First, we need to create the root folder for our project: BIOL125MealwormProject/ Within our root folder, we create a _README.md file to describe our directory structure. Let’s add our project name, date the folder was created and who created it, a short description of the project, group member names, file structure (major folders and their proposed content), and naming conventions to this readme file. Your file should look something like this: _README.md Since we have just started our project, there won’t be files in most subfolders we create. However, it’s good to have the skeleton of what we want our directory to look like so everyone in the group places new files in the correct location. Later, if needed, we can modify our directory structure and update our readme file to reflect those changes. Since we will be using the naming conventions outlined in Chapter 1, we can list those naming conventions here. It may seem strange to outline the naming conventions for documents that haven’t been created yet, but having a strategy for naming files from the beginning of the project is very important. It ensures everyone is following the same set of rules when they add or edit files in the project, which helps everyone stay on the same page when working in a shared directory. Now that our root folder and root readme files are set up, we need to create the subfolders within BIOL125MealwormProject/. Since we outlined the major subfolders in our readme file as Report, Data, Analysis, and Figures, we’ll use these same names when we create the subfolders. Finally, we can open up a new Word document for our lab report and save it to the Report folder using the appropriate naming conventions. Pither_BIOL125MealwormProject_report_V0.docx Here is what our project directory looks like so far: Day 2 Today, we completed a pilot experiment and collected some data. We saved this data file into our project’s corresponding Data folder using appropriate naming conventions. New files: Pither_20210915_BIOL125MealwormProject_food-preference-data.csv Since we have added our first dataset into our project folder, we need to create a corresponding _README.md and _DATA-DICTIONMARY.md. Let’s start by creating the data directory readme and provide a description of our data set, collection methods, who collected the data, and where it was collected. It should look something like this: _README.md Next, let’s create a data dictionary for our new dataset. It should look something like this: _DATA-DICTIONARY.md Now our project directory looks like this: Day 3 Now that our group has completed its pilot project, we decided to expand our data collection and start recording how far mealworms are willing to travel to get food. In addition to this new distance data, we continued to collect data on food preferences. New files: Pither_20210916_BIOL125MealwormProject_food-preference-data.csv Pither_20210916_BIOL125MealwormProject_distance-data.csv Since we have a new dataset, we’ll have to update our data directory readme file with a description of the new dataset. Remember to note the date it was updated and who it was updated by. Our updated data directory _README.md file should look something like this: _README.md Now our updated data directory readme file includes descriptions for both datasets. In the interest of organization, let’s keep our food preferences and distance data in separate subfolders. So, we’ll create two new subfolders within the Data folder. We’ll call one Food-preferences/ and the other Distance/. This way, we can organize csv files into specific folders for each corresponding dataset. After doing this, we need to update the _README.md in our root folder since we’ve modified our directory structure. This readme should now look something like this: _README.md Next, let’s also create a data dictionary for our new dataset within our distance subfolder. Remember to note the date it was updated and who it was updated by. It should look something like this: _DATA-DICTIONARY.md Since we made some updates to our project design and methods, I’ll also go ahead and update our lab report to reflect those changes alongside justification for the changes. Then, I’ll be sure to save my updated lab report using the appropriate naming conventions.

Now it’s time to talk about organizing individual variables within a given file. When properly organized, data values can be effectively analyzed, summarized, and visualized. When not, they can be onerous to work with and risk misinterpretation. In general, your data files should adhere to the principles of \"tidy data\". Tidy data is governed by the following 3 rules1: Each variable must have its own column. Each observation must have its own row. Each value must have its own cell. It’s easy to veer from these rules, as it’s often easier to collect data using data collection tools that violate these rules. When this is the case, we need to know how to re-organize our data to make it \"tidy\". See: Wickham, H. &amp; Grolemund, G. (2017). Tidy Data.

It is often easier to collect data in this way. So, say we collected data about the number of trout caught at local lakes across several days. We might end up with the following data tables if we used a separate table, sheet of paper etc. to record our findings. Site Trout_Caught_Day_1 Mabel-lake 1 Postill-lake 3 Ellison-lake 0 Site Trout_Caught_Day_2 Mabel-lake 1 Postill-lake 3 Ellison-lake 0 Site Trout_Caught_Day_3 Mabel-lake 1 Postill-lake 3 Ellison-lake 0 It is also very likely that we set up an Excel sheet where we recorded the site as the first column and our days and fish caught combined in subsequent columns, one column for each day. Even if we hadn’t collected our data this way, we might be tempted to group our above data together for analysis or assignment submission in this way. Doing this, we’d end up with a table something like the following: Site Trout_Caught_Day_1 Trout_Caught_Day_2 Trout_Caught_Day_3 Mabel-lake 1 3 3 Postill-lake 3 4 5 Ellison-Lake 0 5 1 But for analysis - for \"tidy\" data - we want one column per variable.

Tidy data breaks this down and reserves one column per variable and one row per observation. Remember, we have three variables: site, day, and quantity caught. So let’s transform this… First, working with a collection tool where we have one table per day: Site Day Trout_Caught Mabel-lake 1 1 Postill-lake 1 3 Ellison-lake 1 0 Site Day Trout_Caught Mabel-lake 2 3 Postill-lake 2 4 Ellison-lake 2 5 Site Day Trout_Caught Mabel-lake 3 3 Postill-lake 3 5 Ellison-lake 3 1 And second, gathering this data into a single dataset, sorted by site: Site Day Trout_Caught Mabel-lake 1 1 Mabel-lake 2 3 Mabel-lake 3 3 Postill-lake 1 3 Postill-lake 2 4 Postill-lake 3 5 Ellison-lake 1 0 Ellison-lake 2 5 Ellison-lake 3 1 Now that’s tidy data!

Subsequent figures of the same type can refer to the first for details. See Fig. 2 for an example Use hollow symbols so that overlapping points can be seen (Fig. 3) Orient all text horizontal (except y-axis label), including all tick labels Place axis tick marks outside of the figure border to avoid overlapping with observations Data points should not touch the axes Fitted lines (e.g. least-squares regression) included in figures should be fully explained in the heading, e.g. \"Line represents a least-squares linear regression line, y = 0.3 + 4.5x (F = 5.65, df = 36; P = 0.021)\". For more complex statistics (e.g. lines associated with mixed effects models) refer the reader to the text for details Bar plots should only be used to visualize categorical data (e.g. proportion of students with brown or blue eyes) or counts (number of flies on scat) When comparing numerical data among categories or groups (Figs. 1,2) use stripcharts (Fig. 1) when sample sizes are small (i.e. &lt;20) and boxplots otherwise (Fig. 2). Note that the stripchart has the advantage of showing all the data (i.e. each observation is represented by a point), whereas the boxplot summarizes the data visually. When sample sizes per group are very large, it would get very messy if you tried to show all the data. However, there are graphs like \"violin plots\" that offer a nice compromise. Examples Figure 1.

Your notes may be able to help you explain variability or unexpected results. While detailed written notes can be extremely helpful, their combination with sketches is powerful. Some things you might sketch include: Experiment plan or design. Any apparatus’s used. This is especially handy if you are using a novel method or apparatus.

The same goes for how we construct sketches in biological research. These sketches are generally simple in their articulation and are embedded within your notebook. General Guidelines Do not put a title at the top of your drawing. Instead, place a caption at the bottom left. Captions can be several sentences long and should adequately describe what the sketch is. Use a minimum number of fine lines and use dotted lines to show depth. Do not shade. Place the drawing so that the labels can be put in a column on one side. When possible, labels should be to the right of the figure. Label lines should be straight and should not intersect. Organisms and Structures Some additional guideline to ensure your sketches are clear and readable when drawing organisms or their structures include: Orient your drawing so that the anterior or oral aspect of the organism is at the top of the page. Labelling should be as complete as possible. If any structures have been removed or displaced you should indicate this on your drawing. If the manual or text you are using mentions certain structures that you cannot locate, make a note of this on your drawing. For example, you may say \"nuclei not seen\" in your caption. Genus and species names should be Underlined or Italicized The genus should be Capitalized The specific epithet should be all lower case Microscopes When drawing organisms or structures viewed under the microscope: Do not draw a circle around your drawing.

Markup languages are ideal authoring tools because they work on the principle of separating content from formatting. Markup languages are ideal authoring tools for the sciences because they rely on plain text, so any computer anywhere at any time will be able to open them and consequently, we will be able to read them. Benefits of Markdown: Simple and easy to learn Can be used to generate many different output formats (i.e. pdf, html, docx etc.) Can be read on any device with any operating system Many different web-applications and websites (e.g. Reddit, GitHub) use markdown In fact, when we think about the best practices in science, Markdown is an essential authoring tool because it allows for reproducibility and interpretability (i.e. is independent of specific operating systems or programs).

You write, with markup, in a plain text file. Another application then formats your document based on your markup. This makes markdown very useful for producing many different types of documents from the same piece of prose, whether that be pdf, html, docx, you name it. It also means that you have one working, editable document, which is plain text, and a series of distributable copies in other formats.

A text editor will not format your markdown, it'll just display the plain text. When you open the _README.md files noted throughout this book (either in TextEdit on a Mac or Notepad on Windows), you see the raw, plain text output. TextEdit on your mac is not actually a plain text editor; while TextEdit can read and open a Markdown file, it cannot create a Markdown file. MacOS does not ship with a plain text editor like Notepad on Windows. So if you're on a Mac, you'll need to download a text editor. A dedicated Markdown editor will format your Markdown as you type, so you get an idea as to how it will render if you were to save it as a pdf, html etc. There are a lot of Markdown editors available, many of them free and open source, and many for very specific use cases. When you have some free time, you may choose to check out the following comprehensive list https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/. In between a plain text editor and a dedicated Markdown editor are those text editors with add-ons to help you navigate your markup. These options provide a lot of flexibility and finding a text editor of this ilk that you like will be of benefit going forward in your degree. An excellent free and open source, cross platform option is Atom, which has built in support for Markdown rendering. Atom Download Atom at https://atom.io/ Once downloaded, launch it and you'll be presented with an untitled blank document. Save it somewhere with a file name of your choosing and a file type of .md - so something like, my-first-note.md. You can then toggle Markdown preview on and off with your packages menu Toggling Markdown preview in Atom. One other thing that you'll want to do is to set up how Atom handles tabs. A tab may be either hard or soft. A hard tab is encoded with a tab character, which can throw off the interoperability that we're trying to achieve with using a plain text editor. A soft tab is simply encoded as a series of spaces; this plays much better in general as text is moved between programs and operating systems. So, head into Settings &gt; Editor &gt; Tab Type and ensure that it is set to soft. At the same time, you should probably turn on Soft Wrap.

"],["glossary.html", "12 Glossary", " 12 Glossary Last updated 2022-01-11 A priori hypothesis: Hypothesis that is generated before the research study takes place. Presenting the hypothesis before the study takes place helps in avoiding replacing the hypothesis later with one that fits the data better aka hypothesizing after the fact (HARKing). Alternative hypothesis: In contrast to the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis suggests there is a relationship between phenomena, variables, or populations. In other words, any differences are not the result of random chance. Analysis of variance (ANOVA): A statistical test used to compare the mean of a numeric variable in relation to a single categorical variable that has more than two groups. Assumptions: There are often assumptions associated with statistical tests. This means that for the test to provide reliable results the data must meet specific criteria or conditions. These assumptions need to be checked prior to conducting any analyses. Bias: Error is introduced and false conclusions might be drawn because our sample doesn’t meet established standards for faithful representation of our population of interest. Binomial distribution: A discrete probability distribution of the number of successes where there are exactly two possible outcomes (success and failure). Binomial test: A statistical test that determines the probability of getting a particular proportion when there are exactly two possible outcomes (success and failure). Burden of proof: The obligation that when a causal link is suggested that evidence to support this link must be presented. This can be accomplished through independent replication of studies where if they demonstrate the same conclusions it reinforces the validity of the causal link between those variables. Chi-square (\\(\\chi\\)2) contingency test: A statistical test used to assess whether there is an association between categorical variables. This test is used on contingency tables that are larger than 2 x 2. Chi-square (\\(\\chi\\)2) goodness of fit test: A statistical test used to test how well an observed discrete frequency (or probability) distribution fits some specified expectation. Choice experiment: A type of scientific experiment where a categorical response variable is measured in relation to a manipulated independent variable. Citizen science: When members of the public engage in the research process. Often involving collaboration with researchers. Clinical trials: Experiments that involve i) human participants who are assigned in advance to a group that receives a particular treatment designed to produce a biomedical or behavioural result and ii) evaluation of the effect of the treatments (NIH, 2017) 2)\">Coefficient of determination (R2): The proportion of the variance in the response variable that can be explained or predicted by the independent variable. It describes the strength of the relationship between two variables. Coefficient of variation (CV): A relative measure of variability that indicates the size of a standard deviation in relation to its mean.\" [Frost, Jim n.d.](Coefficient of Variation in Statistics - Statistics By Jim Comma-separated values (CSV) file: A plain text file where each line of the file represents a record and each field (column) entry for that record is separated by a comma. This file format is frequently used by researchers to store data. Confidence interval: An estimated range of values that has an associated probability. The probability describes the likelihood that this range of values will contain the true value of a parameter (ie. mean). For example, a 95% confidence interval suggests we can be 95% confident that the true parameter lies within that range of values. Or in other words, on average we can expect the true parameter to lie in this range, 95% of the time. Confirmatory research: Researchers used a well designed experiment to test the validity of predetermined hypotheses that can be disproved. Continuous quantitative data: Numeric data that lies on a continuum. So there are infinite possible values between integers and our data collection tool or convention determines to what decimal point we record the values to. Some examples include temperature, height, and distance. Critical analysis: Careful examination and evaluation of all parts of a research article including consideration of the study’s strengths and weaknesses as they relate to study design, implementation, data collection, data analysis, and interpretation. Data transformation: A process where the format of the values within a dataset are changed. For example, all of the values within a dataset might be log transformed. This is often done when the original data does not meet the assumptions of a particular statistical test. After the data transformation researchers will re-assess those assumptions to see if they can perform the test on the newly transformed data. Delimiters: One or more characters used to separate strings of text. Some commonly used delimiters include commas (,), colons(:), semicolons(;) and pipes(|). Descriptive statistics: A number used to summarize or describe a given data set or sample. Examples include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and interquartile range. Discrete quantitative data: Numeric data that encompasses only whole integers and no fractions in-between. For example number of people or number or petals on a flower. Diversity: The practice or quality of having individuals who vary in terms of social class, ethnic background, sexual orientation, gender, religion, ability, etc. Effect size: A measure of the degree of association between one variable and another, or in experimental contexts, of the impact of one variable on another. Equity: The practice of treating all segments of society in such a manner that everyone has a similar chance of achieving a given outcome. Some individuals and groups may need more or different support than others to achieve that outcome. “Equality” , in contrast, refers to the practice of providing identical support and opportunities to all. Exploratory research: Research that is performed to gain a better understanding of an existing problem. For example, it might give rise to hypotheses that can then be tested through confirmatory research. File and data management: Refers to practices used to collect, generate, and store data and files throughout the research process. Researchers should document what type of data they have collected, the methods used, and any relevant context. Files and data should be stored such that they are organized, accessible, and interpretable by both the researcher and others. Fisher’s exact test: A statistical test used to assess whether there is an association between categorical variables. This test is used on contingency tables that have exactly 2 x 2 dimensions. HARKing: A form of questionable research practices where the researcher changes their hypothesis after the study is conducted so that the hypothesis better fits the data. In other words, the researcher suggests that this post hoc (after the fact) hypothesis was formed a priori. This has a number of implications including: “harming the progress of science by preventing the research community from identifying already falsified hypotheses, contributes to the replication crisis, and it increases the probability that the findings are not reproducible or generalizable in the population of interest”. (UCDavis Health, n.d.) Hypothesis: A proposed explanation for an observed phenomenon. Often structured in an “If… then… because…” format. Hypotheses must be present a priori, be falsifiable, and measurable. Hypothesis testing: Typically involves setting a null and alternative hypothesis and performing an appropriate statistical analysis to test those hypotheses. Often used in confirmatory research. Inclusion: The philosophy or practice of considering individuals from diverse backgrounds in relation to the community, organization, or society, and ensuring that they feel that they belong, supporting them in giving their best efforts, and giving them equal opportunities to advance and participate in decision-making. Interquartile range: A descriptive statistic that measures the variation within the middle section of a set of values. Specifically, it describes the range between the first and third quartiles of a set of values. Linear regression: A statistical method used to model the linear relationship between independent and dependent variables. Literate programming: A coding paradigm where natural language is written alongside or between lines of code to provide an explanation for the code’s logic. This practice helps enhance reproducibility and understanding by guiding readers through the programmers thought process. Literature review: A review of scholarly sources related to a specific research question or topic. Involves recording a list of research studies consulted, how they were found, and the strengths, limitations, and weaknesses of each. Long format data: A method for organizing data where all of one subject’s observations are represented by distinct rows. Markdown: Markdown is a markup language that is used to format plain text files to help us provide additional meaning to our content. For example, using Markdown you can use bold, italics, and create tables. Markup languages are ideal authoring tools because they work on a principle of separating out content from formatting. Mean: A commonly used descriptive statistic that measures the central tendency of a numeric variable. Specifically, the mean is the arithmetic average of a group of values. Measured response experiment: A type of scientific experiment where a quantitative response variable is measured in relation to a manipulated independent variable. Median: A descriptive statistic measuring the central tendency of a numeric variable. The median is the value separating the upper and lower halves of the variable. In other words the middle value of a group of numbers. Metadata: Data that provides information about other data. Mode: A descriptive statistic for a either a numeric or categorical variable. The mode is the value that appears most frequently. Nominal categorical data: In contrast to ordinal categorical data, this data has two or more discrete categories that have no natural order. For example, hair colour or blood type. o)\">Null hypothesis (Ho): Used alongside the alternative hypothesis in hypothesis testing. The null hypothesis states that there is no significant effect or relationship between phenomena, variables, or populations. Rather any differences observed are the result of random chance. Odds ratio: Measure of the relative odds of the occurrence of a specific event (ie. cancer) given the exposure to a variable of interest (ie. smoking). This ratio is often used to determine the odds of health related outcomes. One-sample t-test: A statistical test used to compare a numeric response variable (ie. mean) to an expected value. Open notebooks: Involves i) publishing or linking to data on an online platform before results are published in a peer-reviewed journal; ii) making information about the methodology and equipment used in a study publicly available; iii) openly discussing both positive and negative results in real time, as they are obtained. Open science: A movement and set of practices intended to combat the replication crisis, QRPs, and style trumping substance by making all parts of the scientific research process transparent and accessible, allowing for a critical review of how a study was conducted, ultimately enabling that study to be independently replicated. It also involves changing scientific culture to reward not just novel findings, but also the many other aspects of conducting good scientific research. Ordinal categorical data: In contrast to nominal categorical data, this data has two or more discrete categories have a natural order but there is no clearly defined interval between each category. For example, storm severity is often classified by stages - Stage 1, Stage 2 … Stage 5 - where Stage 1 is less severe than stage 5. However, we don’t know how much more severe one stage is than the next. P value (p): The probability of getting a result that is the same or more extreme than what was observed. If the probability of getting that result due to random chance is sufficiently low, then it could be interpreted that there is a significant relationship. In contrast, a high p value indicates a larger likelihood that the result was due to random chance and therefore there may be no significant relationship. The p value required to establish significance is set by the researchers in advance of the study and is known as the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)). Paired t-test: A statistical test used to compare the means of two samples where an observation in one sample can be paired with an observation in the other sample. For example, observations might be linked because they were before and after observations on the same subject or in the same place,. Participatory research: Turns the relationship between researcher and subject into a partnership, where both contribute to the research question, methods, and outcomes. Pearson correlation: A statistical test that measures the linear correlation between two numeric variables. Peer review: Peers of the author critically review the author’s study. Traditionally peer review focused on the evaluation of studies prior to publication, however open science practices suggest additional peer review at the study design stage prior to implementation. This ensures the study design meets accepted quality standards before it is conducted. Plain text: Simple text that is human readable. It can includes letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces but does not have any special formatting and is not computationally tagged. Post-hoc test: If a significant result is found when performing a statistical test, post hoc tests can be done to provide more details about where those significant differences are arising from. They are another form of statistical tests. Prediction: The expected results of an experiment based on a specific hypothesis. Probability: Describes the likelihood of an event occurring. For example, when a fair coin is flipped the probability of getting tails is 0.5. Proportion: A number between 0 and 1 that represents the fraction of the total population with a certain attribute. For example, if 10 students have red hair in a school with 100 students, then the proportion of students with red hair is 10/100 or 0.1. Questionable research practices: A grey area of scientific practice in which researchers do not engage in outright misconduct such as fraud or plagiarism, but may unwittingly break rules of acceptable scientific practice in the pursuit of novel and promising results. R: a programming language and free software for statistical computing. When used throughout the research process, it allows for openness in the research workflow and computational reproducibility. Raw data: Data that has been collected but not yet processed in any way. Relative path: In contrast to an absolute path, a relative path is a URL that only contains a portion of the path. It is relative to the root of the document and thus should start the path with the directory name that contains the document. For example, if you are writing a Markdown document and would like to include an image of a mealworm, place the mealworm image into the same directory (folder) as the Markdown document and the relative path may look like /BIOL116/project/mealworm.png. Whereas the absolute path might look like C:://Documents/BIOL116/project/mealworm.png. Random assignment: Assigning participants of a research study to each condition using a method of randomization. This ensures that each participant has an equal chance of being placed in each condition and helps to minimize bias. Range: A descriptive statistic or measure of variation for a set of values. Specifically, it measures the difference between the highest and lowest values. Registered report: “A publishing format that emphasizes the importance of the research question and the quality of methodology by conducting peer review prior to data collection. High quality protocols are then provisionally accepted for publication if the authors follow through with the registered methodology.” Center for Open Science Replication: Thorough repetition of a study, using the same methods but different data. Replication crisis: Many studies cannot be competently analyzed or replicated. This is because critical information about them—design, data, methods, lab notes, analyses and code—may not be made available, or may be poorly communicated. This problem is escalated further because new and original findings are considered more exciting than re-testing or replicating previously conducted studies. Reproducibility: \"Obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis\". Research transparency: The quality or practice of revealing all inputs and outputs of the research process clearly, as well as making evident the exact reasoning and process used in coming to a decision or taking actions in research, in such a way that the study can be replicated. As well, transparency means taking care to disclose important information in a respectful and responsible fashion. Research lifecycle: The traditional research cycle involves five stages, 1) develop idea, 2) design study, 3) collect and analyze data, 4) write report, and 5) publish report. Traditionally, peer review has been conducted after writing the report and prior to publication. However, open science proposes revising the research life cycle by introducing an additional peer review after the study design stage. Scientific method: An empirical method for acquiring knowledge which includes making an observation, asking a question, forming a hypothesis, making a prediction based on the hypothesis, and testing the prediction. Scientific integrity: \"The condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting, reporting, and applying the results of scientific activities that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, inappropriate influence, political interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.\" (USDA, n.d.) Significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)): The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. For example, a significance level of 0.05 means there is a 5% chance that researchers might conclude a significant relationship or difference exists when there is no true relationship or difference. This is also known as the Type I error rate. The significance level is set by researchers before conducting a study and the p value result is compared to the \\(\\alpha\\) to determine if there is a significant relationship or difference. Spearman rank correlation: A nonparametric statistical test that measures the statistical dependence of ranking between two numeric variables. Standard deviation: A type of descriptive statistic that is used to quantify the amount of variation within a set of values. A set of values with a large standard deviation exhibits high variability whereas a low standard deviation indicates the values are close together. Standard error: The standard deviation of the sampling distribution for a specific parameter. For example, if the parameter of interest is the mean, the standard error of the mean would be the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. Statistical analysis: Involves collecting, organizing, exploring, interpreting, and presenting data to uncover patterns or trends in the data. Involves using statistics to describe the study sample and use that sample to make inferences about the population of interest. Statistical significance: If a result is determined to have statistical significance it means that the result from the study is not likely to have occurred randomly or by chance. In other words, the result is likely to be caused by something other than chance. The significance level (𝝰) is set by the researcher in advance of the study being performed. Often 𝝰 is set to 0.05, which indicates a 5% chance of making the wrong decision and determining that the null hypothesis is false when it is in fact true. Study power (aka statistical power): The probability that a random sample taken from a population will lead to rejection of the study’s null hypothesis if that null hypothesis is in fact false. That is, power is a measure of how reliable a study is as a test for its hypothesis; power is positively influenced by things like large sample sizes and relationships characterized by large effect sizes. Two-sample t-test: A statistical test used to compare the means of two independent samples. Variance: A descriptive statistic that \"measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.\" Wikipedia, n.d. In other words, a high variance indicates the values are spread further from the mean whereas a low variance indicates they are close to the mean. Version control: Saving changes to files while retaining the changes on all previous versions of the file. This practice contributes to transparency and openness in science. Wide format data: A method for organizing data where each row represents an individual subject and each column represents an observation for that subject.

The first uses estimation whereas the second, more precise measure, involves calibration of an ocular micrometer. It is very likely that you frequently won't have access to an ocular micrometer, in which case the estimation method should suffice. "],["method-1-estimation.html", "12.2 Method 1: Estimation", " 12.2 Method 1: Estimation Field of View Diameter First, determine the field of view diameter of your microscope for each objective setting. These values might be provided to you in your lab manual. If so, proceed to the next section, estimating object size. To calculate field of view diameter, we first need to know the field number (FN). When you look at your microscope eyepiece, the FN is displayed after the ocular lens magnification. For example, you might see 10x/16. In this case, 10x is the ocular lens magnification and 16 mm is the FN. To calculate the field of view diameter use the following formula: \\[d = \\frac{f}{o}\\] where \\(d\\) = field of view diameter \\(f\\) = field number \\(o\\) = objective magnification Assuming the FN on our microscope is 16 mm, let’s calculate the field of view diameter for the 4x objective. \\[d = \\frac{16 mm}{4} = 4 mm\\] Repeat this process for the remainder of the objectives on your microscope. Your final result should look something like this: Ocular-magnification Objective-magnification Total-magnification Field-of-view-diameter 10x 4x 40x 4 mm 10x 10x 100x 1.6 mm 10x 40x 400x 0.4 mm 10x 100x 1000x 0.16 mm Estimating Object Size Next, estimate the size of the object you are looking at. Since you know the diameter of the field of view for each lens, you can easily estimate the length or size of objects you are looking at by roughly comparing the object's size to the diameter of the circle. The formula for doing this is: \\[o = fr \\times d\\] where \\(o\\) = object size \\(fr\\) = fraction of the field of view taken up by the object \\(d\\) = field of view diameter For example, suppose you are looking at a protozoan that extends 3/4 of the way across the field under 400x total magnification. Using the table above for the microscope in this example, we can see that at 400x total magnification, the objective magnification is 40x and the diameter of the field of view is 0.4 mm. Plugging these numbers into the formula above, we can estimate the length of the object at 0.3 mm. \\[o = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 0.4mm = 0.3mm\\] Caption Estimating object size.Image produced by Clerissa Copeland licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 "],["method-2-ocular-micrometer.html", "12.3 Method 2: Ocular Micrometer", " 12.3 Method 2: Ocular Micrometer The ocular micrometer is inserted into one of the eyepieces of the microscope and looks like a ruler. Caption The Ocular Micrometer.Image produced by Mathew Vis-Dunbar licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 The distance between the markings on the micrometer are used to measure objects in the field of view and represent different sizes of increments at different magnifications because the diameter of the field of view decreases as the magnification increases. In order to determine the size represented by the increments at different magnifications, the ocular micrometer must be calibrated against a stage micrometer (a special slide containing a scale marked off in 10\\(\\mu\\)m increments). Calibrating the Ocular Micrometer To calibrate the ocular micrometer, follow these steps: Look through the microscope eyepieces and note the ocular micrometer. Obtain a stage micrometer and bring the scale into focus using the 40x objective (remember to focus it first using the 4x and 10x objectives). Rotate the ocular lens tube until the markings of the ocular micrometer are lined up parallel to those of the stage micrometer and superimposed on them. Use the mechanical stage adjustment knob to move the stage micrometer so that the lines of both micrometers coincide at the left edge of the field. Caption Calibration of the ocular micrometer. Note that this diagram is only an example and will not necessarily reflect the alignment you will see under your own microscope.Image produced by Mathew Vis-Dunbar licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0] Starting with the lowest magnification objective, carefully observe and count the number of increments on the ocular micrometer that correspond to a single 10\\(\\mu\\)m division (the smallest division on the stage micrometer) of the stage micrometer. Repeat this for each objective lens. Calculate the size of one ocular micrometer unit using the following formula: \\[o=\\frac{10\\mu m}{u}\\] where \\(o\\) = size of 1 ocular micrometer unit (in \\(\\mu\\)m) 10\\(\\mu m\\) is the width of 1 stage micrometer unit \\(u\\) = # of ocular micrometer units in 1 stage micrometer unit Example: Using a particular objective lens, you find that there are 5 ocular units in one stage micrometer unit. By using the formula above, you can then determine that each ocular micrometer unit for that objective is equal to 2 \\(\\mu\\)m. See the calculations below: \\[o=\\frac{10\\mu m}{5 ocular micrometer units}=2\\mu m\\] Now you can calculate the size of a specimen by counting the number of ocular micrometer increments spanned by the specimen and multiplying it by the width of the ocular micrometer unit at that specific magnification. If your specimen is longer than it is wide, do this for both the width and the length of your specimen. Make sure to measure more than one specimen and report the range of sizes for each dimension to account for the natural variation that occurs in the population. For example, a bacillus-shaped bacterium that ranges between 1 to 5 \\(\\mu m\\) in width and 4 to 10 \\(\\mu m\\) in length would be expressed as 1-5\\(\\mu m\\) x 4-10 \\(\\mu m\\).

In the previous example (Under Estimating object size using field of view diameter), the protozoan drawing is 60 mm and the size of the protozoan was estimated to be 0.3 mm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get a magnification of 200x. \\[m = \\frac{60mm}{0.3mm} = 200\\] Alternatively, you can write this as a ratio with drawing size: real life size. In this case the scale would be 200:1. Place the scale or magnification on the bottom right of your drawing. Units must match and then they cancel out, leaving the \"x\" to indicate magnification. You may also use the word \"times\" instead of \"x\". Here is the final image. Whole (wet) mount of Vorticella campanula viewed at 400x total magnification using a brightfield compound microscope.
