Mealworms (n = 10) were randomly assigned to either a ground apples, strawberries, or Styrofoam food condition. The mealworms were then individually and sequentially placed in an open container beside the food corresponding to their experimental condition. Their behaviour was observed for 5 minutes and whether they ate the food or not was recorded.
