# Sketches & Drawings 

*Last updated `r Sys.Date()`*

We've heard it before, a picture is worth a thousand words. While a common place phrase, it echoes very true in biological research. Describing in text the morphological features of an organism is no easy task. Trying to form a mental image of an organism described in text still more difficult! As a simple example, imagine trying to draw a representation of *Fritillaria pudica* from the botanical description in the [Flora of North America](http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=242101628). No easy task. So let's talk about sketches...

## The Role of Sketches

Detailed notetaking is an essential aspect of the research process. There are countless benefits to taking detailed notes throughout as you work in the lab or on research projects. Some of these benefits include: 

* Increased <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Research-transparency">transparency</a> and openness in your research and thought processes.
* Enhanced <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Reproducibility">reproducibility</a> of your experiments and lab work.
* Your notes may be able to help you explain variability or unexpected results.

While detailed written notes can be extremely helpful, their combination with sketches is powerful. Some things you might sketch include:

* Experiment plan or design. 
* Any apparatus's used. This is especially handy if you are using a novel method or apparatus.
* Organisms or structures viewed under the microscope.
* Organisms or structures viewed during a dissection.

Providing a quick simple sketch alongside your written notes provides additional context to help both yourself and your reader understand what you observed or your train of thought. 

## Sketching Guidelines

As we've seen elsewhere, convention and standards help us communicate in unambiguous terms - they allow others in our field to easily interpret what we\'re trying to say, and they allow us to process our information in computational environments in known and reproducible ways.

The same goes for how we construct sketches in biological research. These sketches are generally simple in their articulation and are embedded within your notebook.

### General Guidelines {-}

* Do **not** put a title at the top of your drawing. Instead, place a caption at the bottom left. Captions can be several sentences long and should adequately describe what the sketch is. 
* Use a minimum number of fine lines and use dotted lines to show depth. Do not shade.
* Place the drawing so that the labels can be put in a column on one side. When possible, labels should be to the right of the figure.
* Label lines should be straight and should not intersect.

### Organisms and Structures {-}

Some additional guideline to ensure your sketches are clear and readable when drawing organisms or their structures include: 

* Orient your drawing so that the anterior or oral aspect of the organism is at the top of the page.
* Labelling should be as complete as possible. If any structures have been removed or displaced you should indicate this on your drawing. If the manual or text you are using mentions certain structures that you cannot locate, make a note of this on your drawing. For example, you may say \"nuclei not seen\" in your caption. 
* Genus and species names should be
  * <ins>Underlined</ins> or *Italicized*
  * The genus should be Capitalized
  * The specific epithet should be all lower case
  
### Microscopes {-}

When drawing organisms or structures viewed under the microscope:

* Do not draw a circle around your drawing.
* Put the scale (or magnification) of your drawing at the bottom right of your drawing. Instructions for determining scale/magnification [can be found here](a-magnification-of-a-drawing.html). 

## Good Example Sketches

### Example 1 {-}

This sketch is properly labeled and label lines do not intersect. It contains a descriptive caption below the sketch with the species identified with proper formatting and capitalization and scale noted.

### Example 2 {-}

This figure is properly labeled and label lines do not intersect. It contains a descriptive caption below the sketch for easy interpretation, and depth is indicated with a dashed line.

## Poor Example Sketch

This figure is not directed to have the anterior region at the top, the labelling, while potentially accurate, is not all directionally to the right of the drawing itself. It employs shading and it\'s wrapped in a circle. Did we miss anything? Oh, the caption is above, not below the sketch and the genus and specific epithet are not properly formatted.
